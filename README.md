# 🦎 Lox Interpreter

Welcome to **lox-interpreter**, a personal project where I build the Lox programming language from scratch by following the book **[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)** by Bob Nystrom. This journey is both a deep dive into the foundations of language design and an exploration of the engineering principles behind building interpreters and virtual machines.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- 📚 **Use the theory** behind interpreters, syntax trees, parsing, and runtime environments.
- 🛠️ **Build a complete interpreter** for the Lox language in a clean, modular, and understandable way.
- 🤿 **Understand language internals** such as scoping, closures, memory management, and object orientation.
- 🧠 **Strengthen problem-solving** and low-level thinking by implementing everything manually.

## 🔧 Project Structure

This repository will follow the structure presented in *Crafting Interpreters*:

- `lox/` – The Lox interpreter source code (in Java).
- `tools/` – Any supporting tools like the AST generator.
- `examples/` – Sample Lox programs to test features.
- `notes/` – Personal notes, learnings, and chapter summaries.

## 🌐 About Lox

**Lox** is a dynamically-typed, object-oriented programming language designed for simplicity and educational purposes. It features:

- Classes and inheritance
- Lexical scoping
- First-class functions and closures
- A garbage-collected runtime
- REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) support
